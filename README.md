use it here: https://hyphen-ated.github.io/calendarchart/chart.html

simple calendar tool based on the example at https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/calendar

you can put in dates and it will render each date as a blue square on a calendar

I use this for e.g. displaying what days of the year I went to the gym
